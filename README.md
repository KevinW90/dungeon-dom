# DungeonDom - RPG Game

## Description

This is an RPG dungeon-crawler game. You can explore infinite rooms and fight monsters. The game ends when you die. After that, you'll need to restart the game to play again.

## About

This game was created as a project to learn game development with a web-based background. It is created using Svelte. It follows the tutorial from Drew Conley's Pizza Legends game. The first video can be found (here)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyi4vfbKEeo]. The assests (characters, tiles, etc) are different from the tutorial, but the game logic is pretty much the same. I switched out any classes that create elements to use Svelte instead. The maps are procedurally generated, and obstacles are randomly placed. The game is not finished, but it is playable; expect bugs. There are only a few things you can do in the game right now, but I plan to add more features in the future:

- Explore two rooms (demo and second room)
- Interact with NPCs (use the 'Enter' key to talk to NPCs)
- One tile in the demo room changes the map to the second room (can you find it?) (Once in the second room, you'll need to reload the page to go back to the demo room)
- Text messages for the NPC interaction can be skipped through and ended with 'Enter'
- Movement is with WASD or arrow keys

This is a branch from a project I created with the help of (heykc)[https://github.com/heykc]. In that version, it was a touch-based game created with VanillaJS and the native WebComponents API. You can find that version (here)[https://github.com/heykc/READMEDungeon].
